## Impact of declining birth rate

In fact, once the population decline becomes a trend, it is very difficult to change, even in some European countries to encourage childbirth, but most families still do not want to have more children. For society as a whole, a declining birth rate has a number of implications.

The first is the aging of the population. As the population ages, the problem of the elderly population will become more and more prominent, mainly focusing on the issue of support and care for the elderly. In addition, the health and medical care of the elderly, singleness and remarriage, and the relationship with children need to be studied.

The second issue is the problem of only child. As the fertility rate decreases, the number of one-child families is increasing. The social relationship between family members will undergo great changes, and the status of only-child families and how to raise and educate only-children have attracted widespread social concern.

Finally, the quality of education per capita is declining. Because of the different effects of the implementation of the fertility policy in urban and rural areas, the growth rate of the rural population is much higher than the urban; and because the majority of China's population lives in rural areas, objectively accelerated the growth rate of the rural population; especially in the current dual economy, urban and rural areas are isolated from each other, in a certain area, and to a certain extent will lead to the physical and cultural and educational quality of the population The relative decline in the quality of physical and cultural education of the population.
